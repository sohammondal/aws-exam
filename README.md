## Auto Scaling
* Launch configuration: a template used by ASG to launch new instance. stuff like ami, instance type, ip address, storage volumne, SG etc... similar steps as to when creating a new EC2 instance. 
* Auto Scaling Group: defines the desired capacity of group using scaling policie. and where the group should place resources such as which AZ. 
* ELB can be associated with ASG to attach/detach instances based on scaling policy

## ECS(EC2 Container Service)
* clusters can only scale in a single region.
* Instances within ECS cluster have Docker daemon and ECS agent so that the ECS command can be translated to Docker commands. 
* ECS `task definitioin`(json format) is like ASG for ec2 defining variables for the cluster. The cluster uses IAM role to access required resources.
* max 10 tasks per instance(host). max 10 containers per taks definition. One LB per service.  

## Elastic BeanStalk
* A service to help you deploy web application
* the application version typically points to some artifacts in S3.
* All in all, it takes the uploaded Web application code and automatically provision and deploy the appropriate resources to make the web application operational.

## Aws Batch
* Job-> exeutable/shellscripts etc
* Job definitions -> specific params for jobs like cpus/data volumns/iam roles etc
* job queue -> scheduled jobs are placed into a job queue until they run. 
* job scheduling -> takes care of when a job shoudl be run and from which Env. typically FIFO. 
* compute env -> ecs or unmanged Env(maanged/maintain ourself). 

## Lightsail
* a Virtual Private Server backed by aws. resembles EC2 but simpler and easier, good for small scale use cases.
  * pick a instance, add a launch script(sh), keypair, instance plan(pay). AZ(optional), 

## S3
* multi-regions.  objects are copied within region across different AZs. Bucketname cannot be changed. 
* object-size: **0-5TB**. single upload put limit: **5GB**.
* maximun number of S3 buckets per aws account: **100**.
* Amazon S3 bucket names are globally unique, regardless of the AWS Region in which you create the bucket.
* Access control
  * IAM policy -> user/role
  * ACL(Access control list) which is legacy -> add permissions on indicidual objects. 
  * bucket policy -> add/deny permissions across some or all objects within a single bucket. (higher priority to user/role policy). 
  * query string auth -> share objects via URLs that are valid for a specified period of time. 
* [encrypt content](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-prevent-uploads-of-unencrypted-objects-to-amazon-s3/). The below values are passed via http header when `put`. 
  * SSE with Amazon managed keys (SSE-S3)
  * SSE with KMS-managed keys, customer maintains a master key rather than encryption key. (SSE-KMS)
  * SSE with customer privoded keys. you provide the encryption keys to Amazon, and they encrypt all data with your public key so that ONLY you can only read the data with your private key. This means nobody at Amazon can ever read your files, but you are totally screwed if you lose or damage your key; Amazon cannot help you recover.  (SSE-C)
* Storage classes
  ![s3-storage-classes](/images/s3-storage-classes.png?raw=true "types of S3 Strage classes")
  * `Infrequent Access` (Standard - IA) is an Amazon S3 storage class for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Standard - IA offers the high durability, throughput, and low latency of Amazon S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance make Standard - IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery.
  * `Reduced Redundancy Storage`: [deprecated according to here](https://mysteriouscode.io/blog/aws-s3-storage-classes-pricing-is-not-what-you-think/). an Amazon S3 storage option that enables customers to store noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3â€™s standard storage. It provides a highly available solution for distributing or sharing content that is durably stored elsewhere, or for storing thumbnails, transcoded media, or other processed data that can be easily reproduced. 
* versioning(file with same name), lifecycle( days to move lower classes or glacier). access log. event integrate with sns/sqs/lambda. cross region replication. 
* to make files available to CDN, we could make the bucket files public by setting bucket policy:
```
{
  "Id": "Policy1380877762691",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1380877761162",
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "*"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
* URL pattern can be v-host style or path style
  * virtual host style: http://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com OR http://bucket.s3-aws-region.amazonaws.com
  * path style: `US East (N. Virginia) region endpoint`, http://s3.amazonaws.com/*bucketName*.  `other Region-specific endpoint`, http://s3-*aws-region*.amazonaws.com/*bucketName*
  * for website, it will be http(s)://*bucketName*.s3-website-*aws-region*.amazonaws.com/
* s3 has `read-after-write` consistency for `PUT` of new object, and `eventual` consistency for `PUT` on existing object and `Delete` http request.
* mimimun object size for S3-IA is 128KB. 
* add `x-amz-website-redirect-location` for website/webpage redirect. 
* in a versioned bucket, Only the **bucket owner** can delete a specified object version.

## EBS
* snapshot store data on volumns in S3 which is replicated to multiple AZs. EBS volumns are replicated within a specific AZ, snapshots are tied to the region. snapshots can be shared across regions. 
* HDD[thrput optimized(ETL etc...) or cold], SSD, Magnetic volumns 
* max volumn **16TB**
* Data stored on EBS volumes is automatically and redundantly stored in multiple physical volumes in the same availability zone as part of the normal operations of the EBS service at no additional charge.

## AWS storage gateway
* a hybrid storage service that enables your on-premises applications to seamlessly use AWS cloud storage.
* It could run on premise as a  virtual appliance that can be used to cache S3 locally at a customers site.

## SQS
* default visibility timeout 30s. Max 12 hours.  
* msg retention period: 4 days(1 min to 2 weeks). Max msg size 256K. Receive msg wait time 0s.  
* message order not guarateed.  
* When the message visibility timeout expires, the message becomes available for processing by other EC2 instances. the maximum `VisibilityTimeout` of a message is 12 hours and default is 30s.
* most of time,  short poll is not ideal since it does not query all the servers. long polling default timeout: `20s`.  

## SNS
* Fully Managed Push message service. (email/sms/email)  
* A request can be up to 256kb(xml/json/unfomratted). 
* 

## SWF(simple workflow service)
* A full managed State Tracker and Task Coordinator. Components: Taks, Marker, Timer, Singal. 

## CloudTrail
* A web service that records API calls made on your accound and delivers log files to your amazon s3 bucket 
* An event has info about: Logs, the identity of the caller, the time of te call, the source IP, the request params, the response elements returned by the AWS service
* delivers an event within 15 mins of the API call. logs file every 5 mins. 

## Ops works
* A configuration management service that enables you and operate applications of all shapes and sizes using **Chef**.
* create up to 40 stacks, each stack can hold up to 40 layers, 40 instances and 40 apps. 

## EC2
* By default, you can only have **5** Elastic IP addresses per region.
* You are billed instance-hours as long as your EC2 instance is in a running state.
* The Elastic IP is a static public IP address that is associated with you Amazon account. When you have an Elastic IP address, you can seamlessly disassociate the IP address from an Instance and re-associate it to another instance. When this occurs, the name of the new instance is automatically mapped in DNS. With a standard static public IP address, there is no seamless transition, this process must be done by the user which creates service downtime. 
* ec3 metadata url: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
* we can use IAM roles for temporary credentials in ec2 which has a hidden process to retrieve temp credential automatically. In [java](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/java-dg-roles.html), we can use `InstanceProfileCredentialsProvider` to create client without having to get credential from sts manually. With `aws cli`, it should work out of box. some more explanation [here](http://parthicloud.com/how-to-access-s3-bucket-from-application-on-amazon-ec2-without-access-credentials/). To access the temp credentail via command line, run: `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/role_name_goes_here` according to this [post](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2017/04/27/using-iam-roles-on-amazon-web-services-to-generate-temporary-credentials-for-ec2-instances/), which also provided the piped sed/awk command to extract the accessid/secrte.   
* Uptime SLA for EC2/EBS is 99.95% 
* The ELB  `X-Forwarded-For` request header helps you identify the IP address of a client when you use HTTP/HTTPS load balancer.

## RDS
* auto backup, stored in S3. might be slightly deley/latency during backup. 
* snapshot, maually, exist even the RDS instance is gone. 
* encryption cannot be applied to the running instances. 
* multi-AZ, auto failover to the standby without change connection string etc. for **Disaster only**. 
* read-replica, for read performance/scaling, up to 5 instances and must have the auto-backup turned on. using `async` replication. Same AZ.  
* Aurora
  * mysql compatible relational database. 
  * auto scale from 10G to 64TB. 2 copies in each AZ and minium in 3 az, so 6 copies. 
* backup retention period, 1(default) to 35 days. 	 

## dynamo
* eventual vs read consistency(auto copy to 3 AZs). 
* 1 write per second is one uint. good price for read, and not for write. $0.0065 per 10 write/50 read.  
* easy to scale(push button) comparing to RDS relational. 
* major limitations: 1. 400KB max item size. 2. 10 indexes per table
* The maximum item size in DynamoDB is 400 KB, which includes both attribute name binary length (UTF-8 length) and attribute value lengths (again binary length). The attribute name counts towards the size limit.

## redshift
* single node, multi-node(1. lead node which manage connections and queries. 2.compute node). 
* column based. advanced compresion. only avail in 1 AZ
* default block size for columnar storage is 1M, which is more efficient and further reduces the number of I/O requests needed to perform any database loading or other operations that are part of query execution.

## elasticache
* improve latency and thruput of read heavy.
* Options: Redis and Memcached. 

## Route 53
* difference with cname, alias record can map naked domain name(`example.com`), but cname cannot(it can only map to like www.example.com, server1.example.com). and cname get charged but alias does not. 
* In addition to hosting domains, Route 53 serves as a domain registrar

## VPC
* A VPC spans all the Availability Zones in the region. After creating a VPC, you can add one or more subnets in each Availability Zone. When you create a subnet, you specify the CIDR block for the subnet, which is a subset of the VPC CIDR block. **Each subnet must reside entirely within one Availability Zone and cannot span zones**. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. By launching instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location. We assign a unique ID to each subnet. 
* AZ is like a æœºæˆ¿ã€‚vpc is like a datacenter. region is like ä¸€ä¸ªåœ°åŒºã€‚
* good explanation of [difference between public and private subnet](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22212017/1486742). Basically public subnet use `Internet Gateway` as default route and private subnet uses `NAT` as route. So the instance in public subnet with public IP will have internet acess since the route will use that IP directly. Inbound wise, with public IP, it could also be accessed if SG/ACL allows. For instance in private subnet, instance-initiated outbound internet access is possbile via NAT. However, ourside-world-init inbound access cannot be done since there is no public IP associate to the private subnet instance.
* To create a public subnet: 
  * create a internet gateway and attached to the custom vpc(one IGW for 1 vpc)
  * create a new route table so that we do not change the default `main` route table. add the ip range(0.0.0.0/0) below the `local` and use the IGW(internet gateway) as target. This means all desitination other than our local subnet ip addresses will go to internet via IGW. We do not use main otherwise all subnet will have internet access. 
  * associate subnet to the route tabel we just created in the `Subnet Association` tab in this route table. 
  * for public subnet, we can turn on auto assign public ip  in the `subnet actions` . 
* for NAT instance, we can create a NAT ec2 instance in the public subnet. then in `actions -> networking -> change source/dest check`, disable it so that it would act as the middle man rather than a source/dest. In the `main` route table, add `0.0.0.0/0` below the local and add the target as the the NAT Ec2 instance, which means all subnet other than public will use this NAT to access internet.   
* for NAT Gateway(more preferable, no ec2 maintanence comparing to NAT instance which is a single point of failure). On creation, selection public subnet where this NAT gateway will be deployed to. And then create a Elastic IP. Then in the route table, do the same thing as in the NAT instance.  
* ACL vs SG, ACL is on the subnet level, support allow and deny rule, stateless that return traffic must be explicitly allowd, rules are tested sequetially(smaller first/higher priority).   where as SG is on instance level, support allow rule only, stateful that return traffic is automatically allowed regardless of any rule.  
* one subnet can only associate with one network ACL. We need to add [Ephemeral port](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_ACLs.html#VPC_ACLs_Ephemeral_Ports) to the allow list if client init traffic. 
* vpc log flow allow log all traffic to the vpc into the cloudwatch. 
* vpc peering does not support *edge-to-edge* routing. so settings on vpc-a cannot be shared by vpc-b even they are peered. 
* vpn connection between on-prem and vpc requires Hardware VPN Acess, on-prem Customer Gateway and a Virtual Private Gateway. 

## IAM
* [IAM Policy Evaluation Logic](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#policy-eval-denyallow). it assumes deny first, and then  evaluates deny then evaluate allow. 
* The distinction between a request being denied by default and an explicit deny in a policy is important. By default, a request is denied, but this can be overridden by an allow. In contrast, if a policy explicitly denies a request, that deny can't be overridden. [good example](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html#AccessPolicyLanguage_Interplay)

## Cloudfront
* you can write file directly to edge
* object expires in 24hr by default and minium is 3600s(one hour). you can change the CloudFront settings for Minimum TTL, Maximum TTL, and Default TTL for a cache behavior. 
* invalidate has 3000 object per distribution one time.  
* Create an Origin Access Identity (OAI) for CloudFront and grant access to the objects in your S3 bucket to that OAI and create signed url using java/perl etc... 

## Misc
* AWS support 2 `Virtualizations`: para and Hardware 
* AWS Trusted Advisor: Security Groups - Specific Ports Unrestricted, IAM Use, MFA on Root Account, EBS Public Snapshots, RDS Public Snapshots
* large file transfer: snowball or aws-import/export 
* storage gateway.
  * gateway cached: storing all the data on s3 and cache frequently-used data locally.
  * gateway stored: use s3 to backup the data but store locally.
